Abstract

   To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit
   incoming requests, for example, based upon the source IP address.
   However, oblivious HTTP removes the ability for the server to
   distinguish amongst clients so the server can only rate-limit traffic
   from the oblivious relay.  This harms all clients behind that
   oblivious relay.

   This specification enables a server to convey rate-limit information
   to an oblivious relay, which can use it to apply rate-limit policies
   on clients.  Cooperating oblivious relays can thus provide more
   equitable service to their distinguishable clients without impacting
   on all clients behind that oblivious relay.

1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] requires three parties to exchange HTTP
   messages: the client, the relay, and the target (formally, the
   Oblivious Gateway Resource and Oblivious Target Resource).  Oblivious
   HTTP enables a client to send requests to a target in such a way that
   the target cannot tell whether two requests came from the same
   client, and the relay cannot see the contents of the requests.

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Relay Feedback            October 2022


   Since clients are located behind a relay, a target cannot distinguish
   between well-behaving and malicious clients: an unexpected behavior
   from one or more clients can then impact on all the intermediated
   clients, as described in Section 8.2.1 of [OHTTP].  This can be
   problematic when the target implements rate limiting policies based
   on an information masked by the intermediary, such as the source IP
   address.

   This document defines a mechanism that allows Oblivious gateway and
   target resource to provide rate-limit information to an Oblivious
   relay via the RateLimit fields defined in [RATELIMIT].  This is
   useful when such servers identify traffic anomalies or unexpected
   request volumes.  The Oblivious relay can then use this information
   to apply rate-limit policies on clients.

   While [RATELIMIT] provides enough information to generic clients to
   shape their request policy and avoid being throttled out, this
   specification allows an Oblivious gateway and target resource to
   indicate their RateLimit information is intended for the Oblivious
   relay (rather than to the client).

   How an Oblivious relay can use this information to avoid being
   throttled out or shape its request policy is outside the scope of
   this specification.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "content", "receiver", "request", and "response" are to be
   interpreted as described in [HTTP].

   The terms "Encapsulated request", "Encapsulated response", "Oblivious
   relay resource", "Oblivious gateway resource", "Oblivious target
   resource", and "Client" are to be interpreted as described in
   [OHTTP].

   The collective term "Oblivious resource" indicates either an
   "Oblivious gateway resource" or an "Oblivious target resource".

   The terms "quota policy", "service limit", "expiring limit", and
   "RateLimit fields" are to be interpreted as described in [RATELIMIT].

   This document uses the Integer type from [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

3.  Providing RateLimit Information to an Oblivious Proxy

   An Oblivious resource that uses RateLimit fields [RATELIMIT] to
   return service limit information MAY add the "ohttp-target" quota
   policy parameter defined in Section 4 to signal to the receiver that
   the associated quota policy is intended for an Oblivious relay.  For
   example, when an Oblivious target identifies a high frequency or high
   volume anomalies in the HTTP requests it would include the "ohttp-
   target" parameter.

   The term "Oblivious Relay Feedback" denotes both the mechanism
   described in this specification and the complete set of RateLimit
   fields together with the "ohttp-target" parameter.

   To know whether the RateLimit fields provides Oblivious Relay
   Feedback (see Section 3.1), an Oblivious relay MUST:

   1.  Identify the quota policy associated to the expiring limit.

   2.  Check whether the "ohttp-target" parameter is present and its
       syntax is correct.

   In the example shown in Figure 1, the expiring limit value is "100",
   so the associated quota policy is the second one.  This quota policy
   includes the "ohttp-target" parameter: this indicates that the
   RateLimit fields are intended for an Oblivious relay.


      RateLimit-Limit: 100
      RateLimit-Policy: 10;w=1, 100;w=60;ohttp-target=1
      RateLimit-Remaining: 8
      RateLimit-Reset: 15

             Figure 1: An Example of Oblivious Proxy Feedback.

4.  The ohttp-target Quota Policy Parameter

4.1.  ohttp-target Parameter

   The following quota policy parameter is defined for the RateLimit-
   Policy field [RATELIMIT]:

   ohttp-target:  Indicates that the associated quota policy provides
      Oblivious Relay Feedback.  This parameter is OPTIONAL.

   The "ohttp-target" parameter has the following syntax:

   ohttp-target = sf-integer



Reddy, et al.             Expires 8 April 2023                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Relay Feedback            October 2022


   Its value MUST be an Integer (Section 3.3.1 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS])
   and indicates whether the quota policy is applicable to all the
   clients that are serviced by the Oblivious relay or applicable only
   to a specific client.  The "ohttp-target" parameter MUST have one of
   the following values:

   1:  Indicates that RateLimit fields are applicable to all the clients
      that are serviced by the same Oblivious relay.

   2:  Indicates that RateLimit fields are applicable only to the
      offending client.  For example, this value is used if the client
      is attacking the server (e.g., the client is using an abnormal
      header that matches an attack pattern).  The Oblivious relay MUST
      NOT enforce the requested rate limit unconditionally otherwise the
      target can take advantage of the differential treatment applied by
      the relay to deanonymize the client.  The mechanisms that relay can use
      to rate-limit the traffic from the offending client but at the
      same time prevent the target to correlate requests from clients
      are discussed in Section 5.

   Other values MUST cause the parameter to be ignored.

   The "ohttp-target" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a
   quota policy.  If the parameter is malformed or its value is invalid,
   it MUST be ignored, and the receiving Oblivious relay MUST NOT
   attempt to fix neither the parameter nor its value.  That is, the
   RateLimit fields must not be considered as providing Oblivious Relay
   Feedback.

4.2.  Processing the ohttp-target Parameter

   An Oblivious relay receiving RateLimit fields providing Oblivious
   Relay Feedback will do the following:

   1.  It MUST remove the RateLimit fields from the response, since they
       are not intended to be forwarded to clients.

   2.  It MAY add a new set of RateLimit fields that are intended to be
       forwarded to a client.

   An Oblivious gateway resource receiving RateLimit fields providing
   Oblivious Relay Feedback MUST proceed as follows:

   1.  Remove the RateLimit fields from the HTTP response, since they
       are not intended to be forwarded to the client.  It, then,
       encapsulates the HTTP response.





Reddy, et al.             Expires 8 April 2023                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Relay Feedback            October 2022


   2.  Add the above RateLimit fields to the response containing the
       encapsulated response sent to the Oblivious relay, so that the
       Oblivious relay can access them.

   If the RateLimit fields along with the "ohttp-target" parameter are
   generated by the Oblivious gateway resource before removing the
   protection (including being unable to remove the encapsulation for
   any reason)(Section 6.2 of [OHTTP]), it will result in the RateLimit
   fields added in the response being sent without protection in
   response to a POST request from a client.

   While this specification does not mandate specific traffic shaping
   actions for Oblivious proxies in addition to the ones indicated in
   [RATELIMIT], an Oblivious relay failing to reshape traffic from a
   specific client or from all the clients according to the received
   Oblivious Relay Feedback can experience different levels of service
   denial by the Oblivious gateway and target resources.  There is no
   explicit mechanism for an Oblivious relay to indicate to the server
   that the rate-limit information was processed or was ignored.

5.  Prevent Client identification

   The following mechanisms are RECOMMENDED to be used by an Oblivious
   relay to process "ohttp-target" parameter with a value set to '2':

   1.  The Oblivious relay does not immediately act to rate-limit the
       traffic from the client but starts maintaining a count of
       responses to the client with "ohttp-target" parameter value set
       to "2" marked as "potential malicious requests" and responses
       without the parameter marked as "legitimate requests".  The
       Oblivious relay can rate-limit requests from the offending client
       for a certain duration (that is implementation-specific) only
       when the client has a very high ratio of "potential malicious
       requests" to "legitimate requests" and the condition explained in
       Step 2 is met.  For instance, if the ratio of "potential
       malicious requests" to legitimate requests" is 500 to 5, which
       means the ratio is very high.  A malicious client sends malformed
       HTTP requests, whereas a benign client sends valid HTTP requests.
       The malformed HTTP requests are linkable whereas the valid HTTP
       requests are not linkable.  The target can see a matching attack
       pattern in multiple requests from that same offending client or
       multiple offending clients.  However, the target will not be able
       to partition the anonymity set of legitimate clients.

   2.  The Oblivious relay enforces the delayed rate-limiting of the
       offending client discussed in step 1 provided a large number of
       clients are actively using the relay to send large volume of
       messages and the total number of benign clients is significantly



Reddy, et al.             Expires 8 April 2023                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Relay Feedback            October 2022


       a large number compared to offending clients (e.g., total clients
       is greater than hundred thousand and benign clients is above
       eighty percent of the total clients).  This way the anonymity set
       of clients sending large volume of messages will be a relatively
       larger number even after rate-limiting the offending clients.
       When a relay forwards large volume of messages from a large
       number of clients after rate-limiting the offending clients, it
       assures better privacy by providing larger sets of messages that
       need to be matched.  For example, if a relay chooses to rate
       limit or block all offending clients, this means that any client
       requests which are not treated this way are known to be non-
       abusive by the gateway but it will not be able to correlate
       requests from large number of clients sending large volume of
       messages.

   3.  The Oblivious relay acts to rate-limit the traffic of the client
       provided it has a bad reputation score for sending attack traffic
       (e.g., many security network security vendors offer client
       reputation score, for instance, see [Reputation]).

   The following mechanisms can be optionally used by an Oblivious relay
   to process "ohttp-target" parameter with a value set to '2':

   a.  The Oblivious relay provider hosts a honeypot of clients or
       leverages a honeypot service to send benign flows to the server.
       The relay checks if it receives the "ohttp-target" parameter set
       to '2' for these benign clients to identify if the target is
       misbehaving.  For example, if the target is oblivious DoH server,
       these clients can send a mix of benign queries to the top one
       million domains and sensitive domains (e.g., Health, Ethnicity,
       Religion, Sexual Orientation, Political Beliefs, Adult etc).  If
       the Oblivious relay receives "ohttp-target" parameter with value
       set to 2 for any these clients, it would identify the target is
       misbehaving and ignores the targeted rate-limit for any other
       client it is serving.  The other advantage of using a honeypot is
       that it increases the size of the the anonymity set of clients
       using a gateway.

   b.  The Oblivious relay can introduce synthetic encapsulated requests
       to simulate equal distribution of sequence of requests to avoid
       any request correlation by the target.

   The above two optional mechanisms need to be used with caution as they would
   increase the load on the relay, gateway and target resources.

Internet-Draft          Oblivious Relay Feedback            October 2022


6.  The attack-severity Quota Policy Parameter

   The following quota policy parameter is defined for the RateLimit-
   Policy field defined in [RATELIMIT]:

   attack-severity:  Is used by the Oblivious resource to convey the
      likeliness that an HTTP request is malicious.  This parameter is
      OPTIONAL.

   attack-severity = sf-string

   Note that sf-string is defined in Section 3.3.3 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

   The value of the "attack-severity" parameter is a String
   (Section 3.3.3 of [RFC8941]) that takes one of the values defined in
   [SEVERITY].  This parameter MUST NOT appear more than once in a quota
   policy.  If the parameter is malformed or its value is invalid, the
   parameter MUST be ignored, and the relays MUST NOT attempt to fix
   neither the parameter nor the value.

7.  Use of The ohttp-target Quota Policy Parameters: An Example

   The example depicted in Figure 2 illustrates the use of the "ohttp-
   target" parameter.  An oblivious target resource receives a malformed
   request and uses the source IP address to identify that it was an
   encapsulated request decapsulated by an oblivious gateway resource.
   The Oblivious target resource generates a 400 response and adds the
   RateLimit fields along with the "ohttp-target" quota policy
   parameter.  The oblivious gateway resource proceeds as follows:

   1.  Copy the RateLimit fields from the original response.

   2.  Remove them from the original response before encapsulating it.

   3.  Generate a single 200 response containing the encapsulated
       response for the oblivious relay resource along with the copied
       RateLimit fields.

   The response that is generated by the Oblivious gateway resource is
   depicted in Figure 3.  This response includes an unregistered,
   informative "comment" quota policy parameter providing the rationale
   for the "attack- severity".

8.  Ohttp-Outside-Encap Header

   The "Ohttp-Outside-Encap" header is defined in this specification
   (Section 10.2.1).  Its purpose is to signal which HTTP headers will
   be removed by the Oblivious gateway.

   When an Oblivious gateway resource sends an HTTP request to an
   Oblivious taget, it adds the "Ohttp-Outside-Encap" header to indicate
   which headers will be removed from the response.

   On receipt of an HTTP response from the Oblivious target resource,
   the Oblivious gateway resource copies the header fields signaled in
   the associated request and removes those headers from the HTTP
   response.  The Oblivious gateway then encapsulates the HTTP response.
   The Oblivious gateway resource adds the copied header fields and
   values to the response containing the encapsulated response, so that
   the Oblivious relay can access and act on them.

   The "Ohttp-Outside-Encap" header is useful in deployments where the
   Oblivious gateway resource and Oblivious target resource are managed
   by separate entities.

   Figure 4 describes the syntax using Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   of the header field, using the grammar defined in [RFC5234] and the
   rules defined in Section 5 of [RFC9110].  The field values of the
   header field conform to the same rules.

     Ohai-Outside-Encap =  header-field *( OWS "|" OWS header-field)
     header-field = token

                Figure 4: Ohttp-Outside-Encap Header Syntax

   Optional white space (OWS) is used as defined in Section 5.6.3 of
   [RFC9110].

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Oblivious HTTP protocol
   (Section 8 of [OHTTP]) as well as the ones for RateLimit fields
   (Section 6 of [RATELIMIT]) apply.  The following sub-sections discuss
   security considerations specific to this specification.

9.1.  Client and Oblivous Proxy Collusion

   While Oblivious HTTP relies upon an Oblivious relay to prevent
   leaking the client identity to the Oblivious resources, it might be
   the case that the Oblivious relay colludes with clients in attacking
   Oblivious resources.  RateLimit fields might disclose operational
   capacity information useful to design denial of service attacks or to
   circumvent defensive measures put in place by the Oblivious resources
   (Section 6.2 of [RATELIMIT]).  The Oblivious target and gateway
   resources SHOULD convey Oblivious Relay Feedback only to trusted
   Oblivious proxies.

9.2.  Attack Categories

   Attacks against the Oblivious Gateway and Target Resources can be
   classified into three primary categories:

   1.  A client deliberately sends a malformed encapsulated request
       causing decryption failure or decryption overload failure on the
       oblivious gateway resource.  This causes the oblivious gateway
       resource to send an error status code back to the oblivious
       relay.

   2.  A client deliberately sends an HTTP request that causes an HTTP
       error on the oblivious target resource.  This might be a
       malformed HTTP request, or request for a missing resource.

   3.  A botnet performing an application layer denial of service attack
       (e.g.  HTTP flood) against an Oblivious resource.  Because each
       bot in a botnet makes seemingly legitimate network requests the
       traffic may appear "normal" in origin, nonetheless as a whole it
       not only can saturate the Oblivious resources, but also makes
       appear the Oblivious relay as an attacker.  This might be too
       many requests from a single client, too many requests from the
       clients behind the same oblivious relay or too many requests from
       all clients on the Internet.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  RateLimit Parameter Value Registrations

   This specification requests IANA to add the following parameters to
   the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) RateLimit Parameters"
   registry defined in [RATELIMIT].

  +=================+=================+================+===============+
  | Field Name      |Parameter Name   |Description     |Specification  |
  +=================+=================+================+===============+

  |                 |                 |                |this document  |
  | RateLimit-Policy|attack-severity  |ohttp ratelimit |Section 5 of   |

10.2.  Registration of new HTTP Header Field

10.2.1.  Ohttp-Outside-Encap Header
